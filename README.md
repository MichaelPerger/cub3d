<h2>Cub3D Project at School 42</h2>
<p> by https://github.com/MabKort and https://github.com/MichaelPerger </p>

<p>During the Cub3D project at School 42, <strong>we</strong> worked on developing our programming and game development skills. The project involved using the C programming language and the RayCasting algorithm to create a 3D maze game that allowed players to move through a maze-like environment and interact with objects in the game world.</p>
<p>Throughout the project, <strong>we</strong> learned a variety of skills and concepts related to programming and game development, such as using the RayCasting algorithm to create a 3D view of the maze environment, applying physical laws and principles to the game world, and texture mapping to add textures to the surfaces of 3D objects in the game world.</p>
<h3>To complete the project, <strong>we</strong> were only allowed use some C programming functions and libraries, including:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>open</li>
    <li>close</li>
    <li>read</li>
    <li>write</li>
    <li>printf</li>
    <li>malloc</li>
    <li>free</li>
    <li>perror</li>
    <li>strerror</li>
    <li>exit</li>
    <li>the math library</li>
    <li>everything <strong>we</strong> coded ourselves in the libft project</li>
</ul>

<h3>As a bonus, we implemented additional features such as:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>A minimap to show the layout of the maze. </li>
     <li>The ability to rotate the player's view using the mouse. </li>
     <li>The inclusion of enemy sprites that move randomly throughout the maze. </li>
     <li>Detection and handling of wall collisions. </li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, the Cub3D project was a challenging but rewarding experience that helped <strong>us</strong> develop our skills as programmers and game developers. By completing the project as a team, <strong>we</strong> gained valuable experience that will help us in our future careers, and <strong>we</strong> feel proud of what <strong>we</strong> were able to achieve together.</p>
<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Clone the project from the repository.</li>
    <li>Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.</li>
    <li>Run the command "<code>make</code>" to compile the project.</li>
    <li>If the compilation was successful, run the command "<code>make run</code>" to start the game.</li>
</ol>
